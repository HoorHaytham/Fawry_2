# ðŸ“š Quantum Book Store

This is a small Java project that simulates an online book store using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

The store can manage three types of books:
-  **Paper Books**: Have stock and are shipped to an address.
-  **EBooks**: Have a file type and are sent by email.
-  **Demo Books**: Only for preview and not for sale.

## âœ¨ Features

-  Add books to the inventory with basic information (ISBN, title, year, price).
-  Remove old books based on specified number of years passed since publication.
-  Buy a book using its ISBN, and choose how it will be delivered depending on the book type.
